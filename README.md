# utChat
## NB! utChat only works on Windows

To use utChat as a client, download utChat_Client, run the program and follow the prompts on screen

To host a utChat server, download utChat_Server and run the program.  
The program will display your local ip, which can be used to connect to the server on a local network by changing the ip in the config.txt file  
To host a remote utChat server, open *at least* the ports 12345-12346  
Each chatroom uses a different port, so if you need more than one, you need to open more ports 12346+  
The clients need your external ip to connect to the server  

## Happy chatting!
